    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village Smiljan, Lika county, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July 1856.</p>
    <p>Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters and an older brother.In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.</p>
    <p>In 1870, Tesla moved far north to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium. The classes were held in German, as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.</p>
    <p>Tesla would later write that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor.Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know
            more of this wonderful force".Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873</p><a id="top" href="#up">TOP</a>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <h3>Budapest Telephone Exchange</h3>
    <p>In 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange.Within a few months upon Tesla's arrival,He was allocated the

            the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and
            soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors.</p>
